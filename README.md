## Features

- Skeleton is a base for all your everyday web-projects. Jump-start your work and develop without starting from zero. Everything you need one fork away.
- This project is powered by [Rosid](https://github.com/electerious/Rosid), a web server with just-in-time pre-processing. JS (with Babel, UglifyJS), SASS (with cssnano, Autoprefixer) and EJS can be used right out of the box.
- Skeleton is just the beginning. Fork it and extend it to your own needs. The predefined structure gives you flexibility and can be modified with ease.

## Requirements

Skeleton dependents on â€¦

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.2.0 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [Bower](http://bower.io)

Make sure to install and update all dependencies before you fork and setup Skeleton.

## Setup

We recommend to download Skeleton from GitHub using git:

Install all required dependencies from both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io) before you start with the development. All steps are combined into one single command, which can be executed when both package managers are installed on your system.

```sh
npm install
```
